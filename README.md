**WHY EDGE GUARD?**

Windows Defender is a security tool designed to protect your computer from various types of threats, including viruses, malware, spyware, and other potentially harmful software. Sometimes, however, Windows Defender may detect non-virus files as threats and quarantine or remove them.

There could be several reasons why this is happening:

**False Positives:** Windows Defender can sometimes mistakenly identify a non-virus file as a threat. This happens when a file or software behaves in a way that is similar to malware or malicious code.

**Outdated Virus Definitions:** Windows Defender uses virus definitions or signatures to detect known threats. If your virus definitions are outdated, Windows Defender may flag a legitimate file as a threat.

**Potentially Unwanted Programs:** Some software programs, such as adware or toolbars, are not technically viruses, but they can still be considered unwanted. Windows Defender may flag these programs as potentially unwanted and remove them.

**User Error:** It is also possible that the file was infected with a virus or malware, but the user may not be aware of it. In this case, Windows Defender is simply doing its job by detecting and removing the threat.

If you are experiencing issues with Windows Defender flagging non-virus files, GOOD NEWS! You can use EDGE GUARD, which is constantly updated and can help you manage this problem.
